<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>

Mental health concerns such as stress, anxiety, and emotional struggles are increasingly common, especially among students and working professionals. Access to immediate, supportive, and empathetic conversations is limited due to social stigma and lack of mental health resources.

This project builds a mental health chatbot powered by Hugging Face models (local) and Groq-enhanced LLMs (cloud), which:

Detects stress levels from text

Identifies emotions, triggers, symptoms, coping mechanisms

Generates empathetic, supportive responses

Provides evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE) for transparency

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This chatbot is an educational demo and not a substitute for professional care. If in crisis, please seek immediate help.
